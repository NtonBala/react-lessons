# DOM Event Listeners in a React Component

React _Synthetic_ Events System allows to listen to all sorts of different events that may occur within React components. However, there's no React-specific methods for listening to events that may occur outside of React components, such as Window events, or DOM events.

This [lesson](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-dom-event-listeners-in-a-react-component) illustrates how this is handled within React-class approach.
