# Concurrent React from Scratch

Based on [Concurrent React From Scratch (ByteConf React)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeyiA9U8Ep8) presentation by [Shawn Wang](https://egghead.io/q/resources-by-shawn-wang).

The project is about understanding mental model of _concurrent_ React by building a tiny clone of it, understanding how React renders components, schedules _Time-Slicing updates_ with a _Work Loop_, understanding _hooks_ and _Suspense_ model.
